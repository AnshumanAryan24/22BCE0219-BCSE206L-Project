| **Course Name** | Foundations of Data Science (BCSE206L) |
| **Project Title** | Population Fertility Dynamics |
| **Dataset Provided** | [Fertility2.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salemprakash/EDA/main/Data/Fertility2.csv) |

## Project Objectives:
1. To conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis of the given dataset to 
understand its underlying distributions and characteristics and prepare a 
model for understanding the chances of a family having another child given 
certain parameters. 
2. To explore the relative dependencies of the involved features from the data 
and try to model how they follow each other. 
3. To compare the model performance based on how many features are 
taken from the given dataset and determine the ones that are most 
significant in determining the chances of the family having another child.
